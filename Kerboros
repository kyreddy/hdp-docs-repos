2 Configuring Ambari and Hadoop for

	2.1 Kerberos Overview
		Security
		authntication: who can come in: “identify”
		authorisation: what can be done


		Kerberos is a third party authentication mechanism involves for users and services :Kerberos server - to authenticate each to the other.
		The Kerberos server itself is known as the Key Distribution Center, or KDC. At a high level,
		it has three parts:
		1. Principals : database of useers and services with their respective Kerberos passwords
		2. An Authentication Server (AS) which performs the ""initial authentication"" and issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)
		3. A Ticket Granting Server (TGS) that issues subsequent service tickets based on the initial TGT


		The set of hosts, users, and services over which the Kerberos server has control is called a realm.
	2.2 Kerberos Principals
		principlae:A principal name in a given realm consists of a primary name and an instance name, in this case the instance
			name is the FQDN of the host that runs that service
		keytab file: As services do not log in with a password to acquire their tickets, their principal's authentication credentials are stored
	2.3.4. (Optional) Install a new MIT KDC
		Install the KDC Server
			1. Install a new version of the KDC server:
				yum install krb5-server krb5-libs krb5-workstation
			2. Using a text editor, open the KDC server configuration file, located by default here:
				vi /etc/krb5.conf
			3. Change the [realms] section
				default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM

				[realms]
				 EXAMPLE.COM = {
				  kdc = master2 #<where kdc is installed>
				  admin_server = master2 #<wherekdc server installed>
				 }
		 Note: it is very important to set  up the KDC server to auto-start on boot. For example:
			RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 6
			chkconfig krb5kdc on
			chkconfig kadmin on
			RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7
			systemctl enable krb5kdc
			systemctl enable kadmin
	4.	Create a Kerberos Admin
		
		1. Create a KDC admin by creating an admin principal.
			kadmin.local -q "addprinc admin/admin"
			Confirm that this admin principal has permissions in the KDC ACL. Using a text editor,
			open the KDC ACL file:
			RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux: to check if able to see content lie this */admin@HADOOP.COM * below file
			vi /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
	5. restart

		  krb5-server.x86_64 0:1.14.1-27.el7_3                                                                                                                                                 

		Complete!
		[root@master2 ~]# vi /etc/krb5.conf
		

		 Create the Kerberos Database
		 kdb5_util create -s	
			entered master ky password "horton"
		start kdc
		[root@master2 ~]# systemctl start krb5kdc
		[root@master2 ~]# systemctl start kadmin

		Create a Kerberos Admin

		Create a KDC admin by creating an admin principal

		kadmin.local -q "addprinc admin/admin"
		password "admin"



		systemctl restart kadmin

		testing::works from anywhere;;;; cd /usr/bin
		/usr/bin/kadmin -s master2 -p admin/admin -r EXAMPLE.COM

2.4. Enabling Kerberos Security

		http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html
		downlaod and put in repos folder
		
		goto mount directory and execute below commandunzip
		Run from all clustor hosts :run the following to extract the policy jars into the JDK installed on your host from repository folder
		unzip -o -j -q jce_policy-8.zip -d /usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_77/jre/lib/security/
